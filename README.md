Wk 2 - homework - portfolio site


text-ocer images in portfolio 

default column, which is the smallest screen size, has adefault padding of 15px left and right

In order to over ride this default coumn styling, I added a class to specifically style it to meet the breif.

The class used was .styling-column for readability.

Padding was added to the images to create two distinct columns. The styles were then included to meet this new class.
